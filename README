This is a simple program that open a .fits file with Astropy.

Some functions:
- Open fits file and display it;
- Plot this fits on a Zscale (Iraf based);
- Plot the extension 1;
	Obs: on program the name for extension 1 is "Masked Pixel" because the .fits I used had
	a mask for pixels on extension 1.
- Print the Minimum, Maximum, Mean and Standard Deviaton of the image;
- You can modify the program for show, instead of zscale, the logarithmic color scale. The program is commented instructing how to do this.
